Hi, I'm Muhammed Vali – a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in software development, problem-solving, and building real-world applications. This GitHub serves as my personal portfolio, showcasing a range of projects that reflect my growth, creativity, and technical skills.

Most of the work here highlights projects I’ve completed during my time at university, particularly at Goldsmiths, University of London. These include everything from web development and data-driven apps to algorithmic problem solving and experimental tech projects. Each repository represents a step in my journey toward becoming a well-rounded developer.

I’m constantly learning and building, so expect regular updates and new additions as I continue to explore new tools, technologies, and ideas. Thanks for checking out my work – and stay tuned for more to come!
